media queries:
@media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
	/* nested styles in here */
	body {
		background-color: black;
	}

	#container {
		width: 600px
	}
}

if media queries arent being triggered as expected, try disabling styles in inspector to see if they trigger, possibly just have to change source order

viewport emulator (or adobe edge inspect) can be used to test how sites look on different devices

background-size: cover    (adjusts background size for different viewports? google it)

every webpage should have viewport meta tag in <head>
<meta name "viewport" content "width=device-width, initial-scale-1">

li role separater class divider (google this)

css animations

div {
	transition: background-color 0.5s ease;
	backround-color: red;
}

div:hover {
	background-color: green;
}

transition property always goes on starting state

@keyframes myFade {
	0% {
		opacity: 1;
	}
	100% {
		opacity: 0;
	}
}
